Plan idea from Brad Traversy.

Create canvas-rendering context
Create the ball object and create the path(draw) the ball
Create the paddle object and create the path(draw) the paddle
Create the bricks object(an array with an array: rows and columns with the blocks)
Blocks will invisible and visible properties
Add an update function to animate(redrawing the canvas using the requestAnimationFrame function which takes in a call back)
Move the paddle using keyboard event handlers
Move the ball along with the paddle
Adding wall boundaries
Increase the score when the bricks break
Redraw the blocks and reset score when game is lost.
